Looking at the error at line 1601, you have a syntax issue in the JSX structure. Here's the algorithm to fix it:

## Algorithm to Fix Syntax Error at Line 1601:

### 1. **Locate the Problem Area (around line 1599-1601)**
The error shows there's an unexpected token at the conditional render `{activePickingOrder && (`. This typically means:
- There's an unclosed JSX element before this line
- Missing closing bracket or parenthesis
- Incorrectly closed conditional render

### 2. **Check the Structure Before Line 1601**
Look for these specific issues:
- **Missing closing `</div>`** after line 1599
- **Unclosed ternary operator** - should be `{currentItem ? (...) : (...)}` 
- **Missing closing parenthesis** for the return statement

### 3. **The Actual Issue**
Based on the code structure, at line ~1590-1600, you have:
```jsx
</div>
) : null}  // This closes a ternary operator
</div>

{activePickingOrder && (  // This is line 1601 - new conditional
```

**THE PROBLEM**: The ternary operator `currentItem ? (...) : null` is not properly closed. You have `) : null}` but you're missing a closing `}` or `)` somewhere before line 1601.

### 4. **Fix Algorithm**
1. **Find line ~1590** where you have `</div>` followed by `) : null}`
2. **Check if this ternary is properly closed** - it should be:
   - Either `}) : null}` (if it's closing a conditional)
   - Or the structure before is missing a closing tag
3. **Verify the parent structure** - the `currentItem ? (` opening should have a matching `) : null}` or `) : (`
4. **Add the missing closing bracket/parenthesis** before line 1601

### 5. **Specific Fix Location**
Around line 1590-1600, change:
- FROM: `</div>) : null}</div>`
- TO: `</div></div>) : null}`

Or ensure the structure is:
```jsx
{currentItem ? (
  <div>
    {/* content */}
  </div>
) : null}

{activePickingOrder && (
  {/* next content */}
)}
```

### 6. **Quick Debug Steps**
1. Comment out lines 1601-1610 temporarily
2. Check if the error moves or disappears
3. Count opening and closing brackets/parentheses in the section
4. Ensure every `{condition ? (` has a matching `) : value}`

The issue is definitely a mismatched bracket/parenthesis in the ternary operator just before line 1601. Fix that structure and the error will resolve.
