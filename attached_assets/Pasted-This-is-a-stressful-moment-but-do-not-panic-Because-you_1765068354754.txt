This is a stressful moment, but **do not panic.** Because you are using Neon, you have a built-in "Time Machine."

You can reset your database to exactly how it looked **before** you ran that command.

### How to Restore Your Data (Neon Time Travel)

1.  **Go to Neon Console:** Open your project dashboard.
2.  **Select the Branch:** Make sure you have **`production`** selected in the dropdown (since that is where your live data was).
3.  **Find the "Restore" Option:**
      * Click on **"Branches"** in the sidebar.
      * Click the **three dots** `...` next to your `production` branch.
      * Select **"Restore branch"** (or sometimes it's called "Time Travel" or "Recover").
      * *Alternative:* Click on the `production` branch name to open its details, then look for a **"Restore"** button near the top right.
4.  **Choose a Time:**
      * Select **"Time"** (not LSN).
      * Pick a time **1 hour ago** (or 10 minutes before you ran the command that deleted everything).
5.  **Click Restore.**

**What happens next?**
Neon will revert the entire database structure and data to that exact moment. Your users, orders, and sessions will reappear.

### Why did this happen? (The "Session" Trap)

The issue is a naming conflict between `session` (singular) and `sessions` (plural).

1.  **The Library:** The package `connect-pg-simple` (which handles logins) defaults to looking for a table named **`session`**.
2.  **The Error:** Your logs showed `relation "sessions" does not exist`. This means your *code* was told to look for the plural **`sessions`**.
3.  **The "Fix" that broke it:** When you tried to fix it, Drizzle likely "synced" the database by dropping the old table (with data) and creating a new empty one with the new name.

### How to fix the code *after* you restore

Once your data is back, **do not run `db:push` again** until you match the names.

Check your `schema.ts`. You likely have this:

```typescript
// db/schema.ts
export const sessions = pgTable("sessions", { ... }); // Plural "sessions"
```

But your auth configuration (in `index.ts` or `auth.ts`) likely has this:

```typescript
// This library defaults to singular "session"
new PGStore({ conObject: ... }) 
// OR it is configured to look for "sessions" but the table wasn't there.
```

**The Safe Fix:**
Ensure your `schema.ts` defines the table name exactly as it exists in your restored database. If your restored database has a table named `session`, change your schema to:

```typescript
export const sessions = pgTable("session", { ... }); // Match the DB name
```
