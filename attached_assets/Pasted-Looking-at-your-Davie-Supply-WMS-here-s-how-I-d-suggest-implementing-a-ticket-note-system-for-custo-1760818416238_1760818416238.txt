Looking at your Davie Supply WMS, here's how I'd suggest implementing a ticket/note system for customer support:

## Simple Approach: Customer Notes

Since you mentioned sometimes you "just want to add a note to a customer", start with a basic notes system:

### Database Structure
Add two new tables to your PostgreSQL:

```sql
-- Basic customer notes
customer_notes (
  id, 
  customer_id (FK),
  note_type (general/support/complaint/reminder),
  content,
  created_by (user_id),
  created_at,
  is_resolved (boolean),
  resolved_at
)

-- If you want follow-ups
note_follow_ups (
  id,
  note_id (FK),
  content,
  created_by,
  created_at
)
```

### Where to Add It in Your UI

1. **Customer Details Page**: Add a "Notes" tab next to order history
   - Quick "Add Note" button that opens a simple modal
   - List of past notes with timestamps
   - Color-code by type (yellow for reminders, red for issues, etc.)

2. **Order Page**: Show a small note indicator if customer has active notes
   - Like a little sticky note icon with a count
   - Hover to preview recent notes

3. **Quick Access**: Add a floating note button on customer-related pages
   - Similar to how support chat widgets work

## Full Ticket System (If You Need More)

If you want a proper ticket system later:

### Additional Features
- **Ticket Status**: Open → In Progress → Resolved
- **Priority Levels**: Low, Medium, High, Urgent
- **Categories**: Shipping issue, Product question, Payment problem, etc.
- **Auto-linking**: Connect tickets to specific orders or products
- **Reminders**: Set follow-up dates that show in a dashboard

### Smart Integration Ideas

1. **Auto-create tickets** from:
   - Returns (already have returns management)
   - Failed payments
   - Shipping delays

2. **Dashboard Widget** showing:
   - Open tickets count
   - Overdue follow-ups
   - Recent customer issues

3. **Search Integration**: Include notes/tickets in your existing search with Vietnamese diacritics support

## Quick Implementation Tips

Since you're using React + TypeScript:

1. **Reuse your existing patterns**:
   - Use your unified form components (like ProductForm)
   - Apply the same card-based layout
   - Keep the mobile-first approach

2. **Storage**: Use localStorage to save draft notes (in case of accidental refresh)

3. **Keyboard shortcuts**: 
   - Ctrl+K to quick-add a note from anywhere
   - Similar to your existing keyboard navigation

Would you like me to create the actual database schema and React components for this? I can make it match your existing code style with Shadcn/ui components and your current architecture.
