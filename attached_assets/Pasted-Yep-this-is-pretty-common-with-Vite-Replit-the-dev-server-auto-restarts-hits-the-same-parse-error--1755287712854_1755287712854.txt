Yep—this is pretty common with Vite/Replit: the dev server auto-restarts, hits the same parse error, crashes again, and loops until you fix the code.

What your screenshot says:
	•	Vite pre-transform error in client/src/pages/Orders/PickPack.tsx
	•	Unexpected token (2073:10) with the caret under </div>
	•	The lines just above look like }}) then </div> and another </div>

That almost always means unbalanced JSX/paren/brace near there (e.g., an extra </div>, missing <div>, or closing )} too early so the next </div> is no longer inside JSX).

Do this (fastest path):
	1.	Open the file and jump to the spot
client/src/pages/Orders/PickPack.tsx → line ~2070–2080.
	2.	Balance the closers
	•	Count from the component’s return ( downwards:
	•	Match every (<JSX> with a corresponding </...>
	•	Match each { with } and ( with )
	•	Your snippet suggests an extra )</div> combo. If you see something like:

return (
  <div>
    {/* ... */}
  )}   // closed a callback/conditional here
  </div>  // now outside JSX -> parser trips on this
  </div>  // and here

either remove the stray </div> or move )} below them so they’re still inside the JSX.

	•	If you really do need multiple top-level siblings, wrap them:

return (
  <>
    <div>...</div>
    <div>...</div>
  </>
)


	3.	Let tools show you the error sooner
	•	Run TypeScript to get a precise location:

npx tsc --noEmit


	•	Optional lint/format:

npx eslint client/src/pages/Orders/PickPack.tsx
npx prettier -w client/src/pages/Orders/PickPack.tsx


	4.	If it still loops after fixing the code
	•	Clear Vite cache: rm -rf node_modules/.vite
	•	Stop and re-run the repl (the Browserslist warning in the log is harmless).
	5.	Gotchas to check right around the error
	•	A .map(...) with JSX missing the return:

items.map(item => {        // <-- block body needs 'return'
  <div>{item.name}</div>
})

Fix:

items.map(item => (
  <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
))
// or
items.map(item => {
  return <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
})


	•	A conditional that closes too early:

{open && (
  <div>...</div>
)}    // after this, any extra </div> will crash



Once that unmatched tag/brace is corrected, the loop stops immediately and the app boots normally.

If you paste ~40 lines around 2073, I’ll point out the exact fix.
