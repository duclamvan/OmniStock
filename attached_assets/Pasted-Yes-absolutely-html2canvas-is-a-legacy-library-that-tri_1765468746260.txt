Yes, absolutely. `html2canvas` is a legacy library that tries to **re-draw** your DOM elements onto a canvas one by one. It essentially "guesses" how CSS works, which is why complex layouts (Flexbox, Grid, rounded corners, shadows) often break or shift weirdly (like the "pushing down" issue you are seeing).

Here are the better, modern alternatives used in professional apps.

### 1\. The Best Client-Side Alternative: `html-to-image` 📸

This is the modern standard for React/frontend apps. Instead of re-drawing the DOM, it wraps your HTML in a special SVG container (`foreignObject`), which allows the browser's own engine to render it accurately.

**Why it's better:**

  * **Pixel Perfect:** It uses the real browser rendering engine, so Flexbox, Grids, and Fonts usually look exactly like they do on screen.
  * **No "Push Down" bugs:** It doesn't struggle with scroll offsets as much as `html2canvas`.

**How to switch:**

1.  **Install it:**

    ```bash
    npm install html-to-image
    ```

2.  **Update your code (React example):**

    ```javascript
    import { toPng } from 'html-to-image';

    const downloadInvoice = async () => {
      // 1. Select the element (e.g., your invoice modal ID)
      const element = document.getElementById('invoice-capture-area');

      if (!element) return;

      try {
        // 2. Convert to PNG data URL
        const dataUrl = await toPng(element, { 
            quality: 0.95,
            backgroundColor: 'white' // Ensures transparent backgrounds don't turn black
        });

        // 3. Trigger Download
        const link = document.createElement('a');
        link.download = 'invoice-ORD-123.png';
        link.href = dataUrl;
        link.click();
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to capture image', error);
      }
    };
    ```

### 2\. The "Quick Fix" for `html2canvas` (If you don't want to install new packages) 🛠️

The "pushing everything from top to bottom" issue is a famous bug in `html2canvas`. It happens because the library calculates the viewport based on your **current scroll position**. If you are scrolled down 500px, it often draws the image 500px lower than it should.

**The Fix:** Force the scroll position to 0 in the config options.

```javascript
html2canvas(element, {
    useCORS: true,       // Helps with images/fonts loading
    scrollY: -window.scrollY, // 👈 THIS fixes the "push down" bug
    scrollX: 0,
    windowWidth: document.documentElement.offsetWidth,
    windowHeight: document.documentElement.offsetHeight
}).then(canvas => {
    // ... save your image
});
```

### Recommendation

  * **Immediate Fix:** Add `scrollY: -window.scrollY` to your current `html2canvas` configuration.
  * **Long-term Fix:** Switch to **`html-to-image`**. It is much more robust for the complex invoice layouts shown in your screenshot.
