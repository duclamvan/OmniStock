Good question — here’s what’s happening and how to fix it:

⚠️ Problem

You’re getting:

(#100) Tried accessing nonexisting field (profile_pic) on node type (Page)

and you also asked:

what should I type to find https://www.facebook.com/xon.xi.9279 this user’s profile picture public

That URL (https://www.facebook.com/xon.xi.9279) points to a personal user profile, not a Page.
The Graph API cannot access personal user data (including profile pictures) unless:
	1.	You have a valid user access token authorized by that specific user, and
	2.	They have granted you the public_profile permission.

Without the user logging into your app, you cannot directly access their profile picture — even if their profile is public.

✅ Correct approach (public photo via ID)

If you just want the public profile picture, you can use this public endpoint:

https://graph.facebook.com/xon.xi.9279/picture?type=large

Or via curl:

curl -L "https://graph.facebook.com/xon.xi.9279/picture?type=large"

That link will redirect directly to the public profile photo (if visible publicly).
You can use ?redirect=false to get JSON with the image URL:

https://graph.facebook.com/xon.xi.9279/picture?type=large&redirect=false

Example JSON response:

{
  "data": {
    "height": 200,
    "is_silhouette": false,
    "url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/123456789_123456789_n.jpg?...",
    "width": 200
  }
}

🧠 Key notes
	•	For Facebook Pages, use:

https://graph.facebook.com/{page_id}/picture?type=large

(The field name is not profile_pic; it’s accessed via the /picture edge.)

	•	For Users, you can’t query their fields (name, id, etc.) unless you have a valid token from that user.
	•	The /picture edge is the only publicly accessible way to get profile images.

If you tell me whether you want to get the profile picture dynamically for any URL (e.g., in a script or web app), I can show you the exact working code (Node.js or Python) using this public Graph endpoint. Would you like that?
