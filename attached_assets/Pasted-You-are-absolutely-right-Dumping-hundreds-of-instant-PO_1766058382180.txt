You are absolutely right. Dumping hundreds of "instant" POS transactions into your main Shipping/Fulfillment list will make it impossible for your warehouse team to see what actually needs to be packed.

However, you **should still save them in the same `orders` database table** so your financial reports remain accurate. The solution is to **filter them out of the main view**.

Here is the professional "Unified Database, Separated UI" strategy to solve this chaos.

### 1\. Database: Add a `channel` Column

First, explicitly label where the order came from. Don't rely on guessing.

**Update `server/db/schema.ts`:**

```typescript
export const orders = pgTable("orders", {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // New Field to distinguish order types
  channel: varchar("channel").default('web'), // Values: 'web', 'pos', 'facebook', 'manual'
});
```

### 2\. The UI Strategy: "Work Queues" vs. "History"

Your main `/orders` page is currently designed as a **Work Queue** (things that need action). POS orders don't need action—they are effectively just "History."

**Implementation Plan:**

#### A. Create a Separate "POS History" Page

Instead of mixing them, give POS its own dedicated home.

  * **Route:** `/pos/history` (or `/pos/orders`)
  * **Purpose:** To look up past receipts, process returns, or reprint tickets.
  * **Access:** Only accessible to Store Staff and Admins.

#### B. Clean Up the Main `/orders` Page

Modify your main Order List component to **exclude** POS orders by default.

**Logic:**

  * **Default Tab ("To Ship"):** `WHERE channel != 'pos' AND fulfillment_status != 'fulfilled'`
  * **"All Orders" Tab:** Shows everything (for search/audit purposes).

### 3\. Code Implementation

**Step A: Update the POS Save Logic**
When submitting from the POS page, explicitly tag it.

```typescript
// client/src/pages/pos/PosPage.tsx
mutate({
  // ... other data
  channel: 'pos', // <--- IMPORTANT
  fulfillmentStatus: 'fulfilled',
  paymentStatus: 'paid'
});
```

**Step B: Update the Order List Queries**
In your backend `GET /api/orders` route, allow filtering.

```typescript
// server/routes/orders.ts
router.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  const { view } = req.query; 

  const whereConditions = [];

  // The "Work Queue" view for Warehouse team
  if (view === 'active') {
    // Hide POS orders and completed orders
    whereConditions.push(ne(orders.channel, 'pos'));
    whereConditions.push(ne(orders.fulfillmentStatus, 'fulfilled'));
  } 
  
  // The "POS" view
  else if (view === 'pos') {
    whereConditions.push(eq(orders.channel, 'pos'));
  }

  // ... execute query with constraints
});
```

### 4\. Visual Recommendation

On your sidebar, separate the concerns physically:

  * **📦 Orders** (The Work Queue)
      * *Directs to `/orders?view=active`*
      * *Only shows items needing packing.*
  * **🏪 Point of Sale**
      * **New Sale** (The POS Interface)
      * **Daily History** (The list of today's POS transactions)

### Summary

  * **Database:** Keep **ONE** `orders` table (crucial for your "Business Reports" to work easily).
  * **UI:** Filter POS orders **OUT** of the main shipping list.
  * **Menu:** Give POS its own "History" button inside the POS section.

This keeps your database clean for analytics but keeps your warehouse team focused only on boxes they need to ship.
