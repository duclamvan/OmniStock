Here's how I'd design your Pick & Pack page for your warehouse workflow:

## Core Workflow Design

**Queue-Based System**
Create a central queue where new orders automatically enter as "Ready to Pick". Pickers grab orders from this queue on a first-come-first-serve basis (or by priority). Once a picker claims an order, it becomes "locked" to them to prevent double-picking. After picking is complete, the order automatically moves to the "Ready to Pack" queue where packers can claim it.

**Visual Status Board**
Design the main page as a kanban-style board with columns: Pending → Picking → Ready to Pack → Packing → Complete. Each order shows as a card that moves across columns. Color-code cards by urgency (red for rush orders, yellow for today's shipments, green for standard).

## Picker Interface

**Mobile-First Design**
Since pickers walk around the warehouse, give them a mobile view showing only their current task. Display a simple checklist of items with warehouse locations sorted by the most efficient walking path. Include big buttons for "Item Picked" that they can tap after scanning each item's barcode.

**Smart Batching**
Allow experienced pickers to grab multiple small orders at once if items are in nearby locations. The system groups these as a "pick wave" and shows which items go to which order using color-coded tags or order numbers.

**Location Guidance**
Show a mini warehouse map highlighting the next item's location. Display breadcrumbs like "Aisle 3 → Shelf B → Level 2" with the location code in large text. For frequently picked items, show quantity available at that location to prevent wasted trips.

## Packer Interface

**Workstation View**
Packers stay at packing stations, so design a desktop-optimized view. Show a queue of orders ready to pack on the left, with the current order details in the center. Include a sidebar showing available packing materials and their current stock levels.

**Verification System**
When a packer claims an order, show them what the picker should have brought. They scan each item to verify it matches what was picked. If something's missing or wrong, they can flag it immediately, which notifies the original picker or a supervisor.

**Packing Guidance**
Based on your existing carton optimization feature, automatically suggest the best box size and show a visual packing diagram. Display special packing instructions for fragile items or customer preferences (like "extra bubble wrap" or "include thank you card").

## Queue Management

**Smart Priority Sorting**
Orders in queues auto-sort by: shipping deadline, customer type (VIP first), order size (group similar sizes for efficiency), and geographic destination (batch orders going to same region).

**Load Balancing**
Show each picker/packer's current workload and average completion time. Suggest task assignments to balance the workload - if one picker is faster, give them slightly larger orders.

**Bottleneck Prevention**
Monitor the "Ready to Pack" queue - if it grows too large, alert supervisors to shift more people to packing. Conversely, if packers are idle, notify that more pickers are needed.

## Performance Tracking

**Real-Time Metrics**
Display a dashboard showing: orders picked/packed today, average pick time per order, items per hour for each employee, and current queue depths. This helps supervisors spot problems quickly.

**Employee Leaderboards**
Show friendly competition metrics like "Fastest Pick Time Today" or "Most Accurate Packer This Week". Track accuracy rates to identify who might need additional training.

## Special Scenarios

**Partial Picks**
If an item is out of stock at the expected location, pickers can mark it as "not found" and continue with other items. The order then goes to a special queue for supervisors to resolve before it reaches packing.

**Rush Order Handling**
Add an "Express Lane" where urgent orders skip to the front of both queues. These get highlighted in red across all interfaces so everyone knows to prioritize them.

**Multi-Location Items**
For items stored in multiple locations, show all options to the picker. If they find insufficient quantity at the first location, guide them to the backup location automatically.

## Communication Features

**Built-in Messaging**
Add quick message buttons like "Need help at Location X" or "Running low on small boxes at Station 3". These create notifications for supervisors without requiring pickers/packers to leave their workflow.

**Handoff Notes**
Let pickers add notes that packers will see, like "Customer requested gift wrapping" or "One item was last unit, slightly damaged box but product OK".

## Integration Points

**Barcode Scanning Everywhere**
Every action should be scannable - claiming an order, confirming item picks, verifying packed items, and marking orders complete. This creates an audit trail and reduces errors.

**Warehouse Map Integration**
Link with your existing 2D warehouse map to show real-time activity - which aisles have pickers currently, which packing stations are active, and where bottlenecks are forming.

This design ensures packers always have fully-picked orders ready to pack, minimizes idle time, and provides clear visibility into the entire fulfillment process.
