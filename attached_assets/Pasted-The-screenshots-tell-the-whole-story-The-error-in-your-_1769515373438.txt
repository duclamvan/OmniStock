The screenshots tell the whole story. The error in your console is **`404 (Not Found)`** for the POST request to `/api/orders/.../documents`.

This is **not** a permission issue or a file size issue. A **404** code simply means: **"The production server does not have this URL endpoint."**

This usually happens because the **Production Build** is out of date. In Dev, you run TypeScript directly (`npm run dev`), but in Production, you likely run compiled JavaScript (`npm start`). If you didn't **re-compile** after adding the upload feature, the server is running old code that doesn't know this route exists.

### How to fix it (3 Steps)

#### 1. Force a Rebuild on Production

You likely pushed the code but didn't rebuild the `dist` folder. Run these commands in your production server terminal:

```bash
# 1. Stop the current server (if using pm2)
pm2 stop all  # (or however you stop your server)

# 2. Re-install dependencies (just in case)
npm install

# 3. BUILD the project (This compiles TS -> JS)
npm run build 

# 4. Restart the server
npm start # (or pm2 start ...)

```

*Note: If `npm run build` fails, check if you have the `build` script defined in `package.json`.*

#### 2. Check your `routes.ts` file

If rebuilding doesn't work, verify that the route actually looks like this in your code. Open your server code and look for:

```typescript
// It must match /api/orders/:id/documents
router.post('/orders/:orderId/documents', upload.single('file'), ...);

```

If your code says `router.post('/upload', ...)` but your frontend calls `/api/orders/.../documents`, that is why you get a 404. **Make them match.**

#### 3. Verify the "API" Prefix

In your `server/index.ts`, make sure the routes are registered with the `/api` prefix:

```typescript
// server/index.ts
import routes from './routes';

// This line is CRITICAL. It makes "/orders" become "/api/orders"
app.use('/api', routes); 

```

**Summary:** The error is "Route Missing" (404). The fix is almost certainly **`npm run build`** on the production server to update the running code.
